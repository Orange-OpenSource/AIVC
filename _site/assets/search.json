AIVC outperforms HEVC for All Intra coding. As such, these results focus on Random Access (RA) and Low-delay P (LDP) configurations.\n\n\nUnlike the results shown in the paper, the anchors here are x264 and x265.

In order to\nbetter understand its behavior, we present some insightful videos based on the\nseparate synthesis of the analysis and conditioning MNet latent variables. We'll\nhave a look at one optical flow $\\color{black}{\\mathbf{v}_p}$ when it is synthesized from:\n\n\n\n   Analysis latent variable only i.e. no decoder-side info used\n   Conditioning latent variable only i.e. not a single bit conveyed\n   Both latent variables\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Optical flow $\\color{black}{\\mathbf{v}_p}$\n        Only from conditioning \n        latent variable\n        Decoder-side only!\n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Optical flow $\\color{black}{\\mathbf{v}_p}$ \n        Only from analysis\n        latent variable \n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Optical flow $\\color{black}{\\mathbf{v}_p}$ \n        From all latent variables \n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nRecall that the conditioning is a decoder-side only transform, so the first\nvideo represents the motion information inferred at the decoder without a\nsingle bit received. Most of the small motions in the background are inferred at\nthe decoder thanks to the conditioning transform. Yet, the motion of the girl in\nthe foreground is too complex to be anticipated at the decoder. Thus, the\nanalysis transform transmits motion information solely for the girl.\n\n",
