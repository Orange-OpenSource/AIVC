I"ó<p>The complete distilling apparatus consists of three parts: the â€œcucurbitâ€ (Arabic á¸³arÊ¿a, Greek Î²Î¯ÎºÎ¿Ï‚), the still pot containing the liquid to be distilled, which is heated by a flame; the â€œheadâ€ or â€œcapâ€ (Arabic anbiá¸³, Greek á¼„Î¼Î²Î¹Î¾) which fits over the mouth of the cucurbit to receive the vapors, with an attached downward-sloping â€œtubeâ€ (Greek ÏƒÏ‰Î»Î®Î½), leading to the â€œreceiverâ€ (Arabic á¸³Äbila, Greek á¼„Î³Î³Î¿Ï‚ or Ï†Î¹Î¬Î»Î·) container.</p>

<p>Retorts have the â€œcapâ€ and the â€œcucurbitâ€ made into one. The anbik is also called the raÊ¾s (head) of the cucurbit. The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver. A modern descendant of the alembic is the pot still, used to produce distilled beverages.</p>
